//
// A truss is a structure that consists of axial members connected by pin joints.
// The loads on a truss are assumed to be concentrated at the joints.
// The members of a truss support the external load through axial force as they do not undergo bending deformation.
// Therefore, no bending moments are present in truss members.
//
// A truss is characterised by
// - 2 points (2 joints, from which we deduce the length L=sqrt((p1_x-p2_x)^2+(p1_y-p2_y)^2+(p1_z-p2_z)^2)
// - a cross section A
// - Youngâ€™s modulus E (specified by the material)
