// A Truss is a structure that consists of axial members connected by pin joints. Here we consider 3D Truss.
// The loads on a Truss are assumed to be concentrated at the joints.
// The members of a Truss support the external load through _axial force_ as they do not undergo bending deformation.
// Therefore, no bending moments are present in Truss members.
//
// A truss is characterised by
// - 2 points (2 joints, from which we deduce its length L=sqrt((p1_x-p2_x)^2+(p1_y-p2_y)^2+(p1_z-p2_z)^2),
// - a cross section A,
// - Youngâ€™s modulus E (specified by the material).
//
// Axial direction is consider to be the local x_l direction. So, the displacements in direction y_l and z_l are null.
//
// Due to restrictions applied to the Truss elements, the only displacements/forces to take into considerations are
// U_i,V_i,W_i per node i along the three global axis x_g,y_g,z_g respectively.
// Since each Truss is defined with 2 nodes, then 6 displacements/forces are to consider in global system.
