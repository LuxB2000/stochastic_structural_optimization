- check with UT if the simpleCornerTruss could be used as a TopCornerTruss

- ForceElement is equal to Inf in structure ...
- Be sure that the ElementForce vector is coherent along the code (It is not the case right now, check structure, GetMaximalElementlForce)

- Truss

- Beam
  - more general class
  - Introducing moments
		- change the sizes of the matrices
	- continuous loads on the element
		- load and weight

	-> NEED to update the Truss.A and Truss.E to take into consideration the meter as unit
	-> NEED to update TrussSolverTest
	-> current solution will not work for mesh coordonates

- doc:
	- Point has index of type int. That limits the spacial precision of the world. 
	- The Point's index is computed as x+y*MAXDIM+z*MAXDIM*MAXDIM.
	- real coordinates world should be express in a relative way and take values between [0,10[
		with a precision 1E-3.

		difference between point index (unic identificater) and point id that is used to represent a point on the truss/scheme or represtentation. The point id is usually used at the Frame or Structure design.

## OLD DOC
This project aims to play with the EASE platform (see http://easea.unistra.fr/easea/index.php/EASEA_platform )
and house building.


#EASEA
Manual: http://easea.unistra.fr/easea/index.php/EASEA_command_line

$ cd easea/v0.1

To Compile EASEA file:
  $ easea main.ez
  $ make
or the CUDA version:
  $ easea -cuda main.ez
  $ make

To test it:
  $ ./main

To clean easea related file:
 $ make easeaclean

!! WARNING: you need to reference the EASEA_house library when you compile the
EASEA file. To do so, you need to specify the path where it is compile in the
*.ez file in section `User Makefile options` using the standard CPPFLAGS and
LDFLAGS variables.
exemple (on MacOs, v...TODO):
(!!!! This could be really different in your system, future versions will profide
pre-compiled libraries)
LDFLAGS += -g /home/plumat/workspace/EASEA_house/bin/Release/libEASEA_house.so

// version
v0.1.a: single beam, goal: find beam rotate to 90 degrees along X0 + min translation
v0.1.b: multi beam, same goal
v0.1.c: incoporate the object gestion
v0.1.d: 2 beams must be linked
