- check with UT if the simpleCornerTruss could be used as a TopCornerTruss

- Error and exception

- Truss

- Beam
  - more general class
  - Introducting moments
		- change the sizes of the matrices
	- continuous loads on the element
		- load and weight


- doc:
	- Point has index of type long double. That limits the spacial precision of the world. 
	- the index is computed as x+y*MAXDIM+z*MAXDIM*MAXDIM.
	- real coordinates world should be express in a relative way and take values between [0,10[
		with a precision 1E-3.

	-> NEED to update the Truss.A and Truss.E to take into consideration the meter as unit
	-> NEED to update TrussSolverTest
	-> current solution will not work for mesh coordonates
